# Redneck Soda Menu

Welcome to the unofficial **Redneck Soda Menu** website! This site was created out of a love for the delicious and unique soda offerings from Redneck Soda in Rexburg, ID. My wife and I often enjoy their drinks but noticed that it was difficult to find an online menu, so we decided to make one ourselves with it hosted in Github Pages.

**Menu**: [ronvallejo.github.io/Redneck-Soda-Menu/](https://ronvallejo.github.io/Redneck-Soda-Menu/)
**Feedback**: [github.com/ronvallejo/Redneck-Soda-Menu/discussions/1](https://github.com/ronvallejo/Redneck-Soda-Menu/discussions/1)

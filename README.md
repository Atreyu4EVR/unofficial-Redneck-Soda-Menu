## About

Welcome to the **Official Repository** for the **unofficial Redneck Soda Menu**! The unofficial Redneck Soda Menu was created out of a love for the delicious and unique soda offerings from Redneck Soda in Rexburg, ID. My wife and I often enjoy their drinks but noticed that it was difficult to find an online menu, so we decided to make one ourselves and host on Github Pages.

This website is a semi-static, mobile-friendly menu that lists all of the soda options currently available on the menu sign at Redneck Soda. The application use to build the menu was created using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications quickly and with minimal overhead. The main file, "app.py" uses Google Sheets API's to fetch the menu items we list from a spreadsheet using Google Sheets. The menu was originally designed with simple HTML, CSS, and JS. But, each time there was a change in the menu, I had to manually update the code. That became old real quick. So I rebuilt the menu in Python using Flask, so I could simply run the script and have it automatically update the webpage. The site is hosted on Github Pages with a custom domain.
